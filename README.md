##Coding Guidelines
1. Don't use magic numbers or hard-coded strings. Put them in dimens.xml or strings.xml
1. Class names should be in CamelCase. Name activities with names including Activity so it's easier to know what they are.
1. Include spaces between parameters when you call a method for example: `Intent(MainActivity.this, GameActivity.class)`.
1. Give relevant names to buttons and other resources. 
1. Use `@id` instead of `@+id` when referring to resources that have been already created in xml files.
